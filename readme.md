===========================================================================

*STILL IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT STAGE*

moge is a c++ library that is written in the latest c++ (currently c++17).
it is created to ease the pain of using modern opengl. currently, only
opengl 3.3 is supported, opengl 4.5 support will come later.

the library provides:

* window creation and destruction and receiving window events
* multiple windows
* a proper "bind" template, optimizing the various bind call of opengl
* type safety
* object-based opengl wrapper
